<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxy Dry Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Type</li><li>Regular Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Oxy Dry Powder market consists of two types: Coated Type and Regular Type. Coated Type refers to powder particles that are coated with a thin layer of protective material. This coating enhances the powder's stability and prevents clumping or lumping during storage or transportation. Regular Type, on the other hand, does not have any protective coating and is more susceptible to clumping. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
