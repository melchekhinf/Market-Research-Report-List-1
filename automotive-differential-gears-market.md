<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Differential Gears Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hypoid Differential Gears</li><li>Spiral Differential Gears</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive differential gears are vital components in vehicles that allow the wheels to rotate at different speeds while maintaining traction. There are two main types of differential gears: hypoid differential gears and spiral differential gears. Hypoid differential gears are commonly used in rear-wheel drive vehicles as they have a smooth operation, low noise, and high torque capacity. On the other hand, spiral differential gears are mostly found in front-wheel drive vehicles, offering better efficiency and durability due to their helical gear design. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring smooth and efficient vehicle performance.</p></p>
