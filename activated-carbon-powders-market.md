<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Activated Carbon Powders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Method</li><li>Chemical Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Activated carbon powders are widely used for their excellent adsorption properties. They can be categorized into two types based on the method used for their production. Physical method involves the controlled carbonization of organic materials such as coal or wood, followed by activation at high temperatures. Chemical method, on the other hand, utilizes chemical agents like zinc chloride or phosphoric acid to impregnate the precursor material, which is then carbonized and activated. Both methods produce high-quality activated carbon powders with varying pore structures and surface areas to suit different applications.</p></p>
