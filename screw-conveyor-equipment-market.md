<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Screw Conveyor Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shaft Screw Conveyor</li><li>Shaftless Screw Conveyor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The screw conveyor equipment market includes two main types: shaft screw conveyors and shaftless screw conveyors. Shaft screw conveyors consist of a central shaft throughout the length of the conveyor, which helps in transmitting rotational power along the screw. On the other hand, shaftless screw conveyors do not have a central shaft and rely on the spiral-shaped screw to move materials. Both types of conveyors are used in various industries to efficiently transport bulk materials such as grains, powders, and liquids.</p></p>
