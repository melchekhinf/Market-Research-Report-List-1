<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency Electrosurgical Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Devices</li><li>Bipolar Devices</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Radiofrequency Electrosurgical Device Market consists of two types: Monopolar Devices and Bipolar Devices. Monopolar devices use a current flowing from the device through the patient's body to a return electrode, allowing for deeper tissue penetration. Bipolar devices, on the other hand, have both the active and return electrodes on the device itself, making them suitable for delicate procedures and reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissues. These devices are widely used in various medical procedures, providing efficient cutting and coagulation capabilities.</p></p>
