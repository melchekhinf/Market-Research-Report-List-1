<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reinforcement Material of Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bead Wire</li><li>Steel Cord</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Reinforcement materials play a crucial role in tire manufacturing. Bead wire and steel cord are two common types used in the market. Bead wire is typically made of high-quality steel and forms the inner ring of the tire, securing it to the wheel rim. Steel cord, on the other hand, is a bundle of fine steel wires often coated with brass or bronze. It provides strength and stability to the tire structure, enhancing its overall performance and durability. Both materials contribute to ensuring the tire remains in shape and can withstand various external forces.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Reinforcement Material of Tire Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagonal Tyre</li><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The reinforcement material of tire market application includes three major segments: diagonal tire, radial tire, and others. Diagonal tires, commonly known as bias ply tires, are constructed with layers of fabric cords running diagonally from bead to bead. Radial tires, on the other hand, employ a belt system with layers of fabric cords running perpendicular to the direction of travel. The "others" category encompasses various reinforcement materials like steel belts, fiberglass, and carbon fiber, which are used in specialized tire applications. These different types of reinforcement materials cater to specific performance requirements, ensuring optimal tire durability and stability for various vehicles and road conditions.</p></p>
