<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Hemoperfusion Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Charcoal Pellet Diffuser</li><li>Resin Pellet Infuser</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Disposable Hemoperfusion Device market includes two types: Charcoal Pellet Diffuser and Resin Pellet Infuser. Charcoal Pellet Diffuser devices utilize activated charcoal pellets to remove toxins from the bloodstream by adsorption. They work by allowing the blood to pass through a cartridge containing the charcoal pellets, which trap the toxins. On the other hand, Resin Pellet Infuser devices use a resin material to bind and remove toxins from the blood via a similar process. Both types of devices are designed for single-use and offer effective toxin removal during hemoperfusion treatment.</p></p>
