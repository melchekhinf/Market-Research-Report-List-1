<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC-C Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Schedule 40</li><li>Schedule 80</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PVC-C pipes are classified into two main types: Schedule 40 and Schedule 80. Schedule 40 PVC-C pipes have a slightly thinner wall thickness and are typically used for applications with low to moderate pressures. On the other hand, Schedule 80 PVC-C pipes have a thicker wall thickness and are suitable for applications that require higher pressure handling. The differences in their wall thickness make Schedule 80 pipes more durable and resistant to damage compared to Schedule 40 pipes. Both types are widely used in plumbing, construction, and industrial applications.</p></p>
