<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Meningococcal Disease Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibiotics</li><li>Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Meningococcal Disease Treatment market includes two main types of products: antibiotics and vaccines. Antibiotics are medications used to treat bacterial infections caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. They work by killing or inhibiting the growth of the bacteria. On the other hand, vaccines are preventive measures that help the body develop immunity against the bacteria responsible for meningococcal disease. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to recognize and fight against the bacteria, reducing the likelihood of infection. Both antibiotics and vaccines play crucial roles in the treatment and prevention of meningococcal disease.</p></p>
