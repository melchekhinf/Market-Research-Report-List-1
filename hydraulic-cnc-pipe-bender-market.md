<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic CNC Pipe Bender Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Head</li><li>Twin-Head</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the Hydraulic CNC Pipe Bender market, there are two types of machines available, namely Single-Head and Twin-Head. Single-Head machines have only one bending head and are suitable for applications that require a single bend in the pipe. On the other hand, Twin-Head machines have two bending heads, allowing for simultaneous bending of two different pipes or different bending angles in the same pipe. Twin-Head machines are preferred for applications that require multiple bends or complex pipe configurations.</p></p>
