<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bare Copper Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Annealed(soft)</li><li>HalfHard</li><li>Hard</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bare copper tape market is divided into three types based on the level of hardness: annealed (soft), half-hard, and hard. Annealed copper tape is the softest variant, making it more flexible and easier to shape. Half-hard copper tape offers a balance between flexibility and rigidity, allowing it to maintain its shape while still being reasonably malleable. On the other hand, hard copper tape is the most rigid and inflexible of the three, making it ideal for applications that require stability and strength.</p></p>
