<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Cutting Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorption Type</li><li>Reflection Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Infrared Cutting Glass market consists of two types: Absorption Type and Reflection Type. In absorption type, the glass absorbs the energy from infrared radiation and converts it into heat, and then the glass is cut using thermal stress. This method is commonly used for thick or large glass cutting. On the other hand, reflection type uses coated glass that reflects the infrared radiation onto the object being cut, thus causing the material to heat up and eventually break. This technique is suitable for thin or small glass cutting applications.</p></p>
