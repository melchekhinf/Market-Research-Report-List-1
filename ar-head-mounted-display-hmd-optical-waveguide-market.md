<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AR Head-mounted Display (HMD) Optical Waveguide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Geometric Waveguide</li><li>Diffractive Waveguide (Surface Relief Grating)</li><li>Diffractive Waveguide (Volume Holographic Gratings)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The AR Head-mounted Display (HMD) Optical Waveguide market consists of three types: Geometric Waveguide, Diffractive Waveguide (Surface Relief Grating), and Diffractive Waveguide (Volume Holographic Gratings). Geometric Waveguide utilizes total internal reflection to guide light within the waveguide. Diffractive Waveguide (Surface Relief Grating) uses microstructures on the waveguide's surface to diffract light and guide it towards the user's eye. Diffractive Waveguide (Volume Holographic Gratings) employs volume holographic gratings to diffract light and redirect it towards the user's eye. These technologies form the foundation for delivering augmented reality experiences through head-mounted displays.</p></p>
