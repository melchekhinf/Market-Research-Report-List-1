<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flotation Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Collector</li><li>Foaming Agent</li><li>Regulator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Flotation Agents Market encompasses three main types of agents: collector, foaming agent, and regulator. Collectors are chemicals that enhance the attachment of minerals to air bubbles, promoting flotation separation. Foaming agents generate stable foam, which carries minerals to the surface during flotation. Regulators control the pH level and modify the surface properties of minerals to improve their flotation efficiency. These agents are essential in the mining and mineral processing industries, aiding the separation and recovery of valuable minerals from ores during the flotation process.</p></p>
