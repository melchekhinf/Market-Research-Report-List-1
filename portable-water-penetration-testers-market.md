<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Water Penetration Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Pressure Difference Method</li><li>Static Pressure Head Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Portable Water Penetration Testers market consists of two main types: the Air Pressure Difference Method and the Static Pressure Head Method. </p><p>In the Air Pressure Difference Method, the tester uses air pressure to measure the water infiltration rate in structures or materials. It creates a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the material and measures the water flow through any gaps or openings.</p><p>On the other hand, the Static Pressure Head Method evaluates the water penetration by applying a constant water pressure on the material's surface. The tester measures the water head height or flow rate to determine the level of water infiltration.</p></p>
