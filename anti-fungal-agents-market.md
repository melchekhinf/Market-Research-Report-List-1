<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Fungal Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Azoles</li><li>Polyenes</li><li>5-fluorocytosine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-fungal agents are medications used to treat fungal infections. They can be categorized into three main types: Azoles, Polyenes, and 5-fluorocytosine. Azoles work by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. Polyenes, on the other hand, disrupt the fungal cell membrane structure by binding to ergosterol. Lastly, 5-fluorocytosine interferes with fungal DNA synthesis. These different types of anti-fungal agents provide a range of options for healthcare professionals to effectively treat various fungal infections.</p></p>
