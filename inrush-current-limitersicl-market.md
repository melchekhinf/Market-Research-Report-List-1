<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inrush Current LimitersICL Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NTC Inrush Current Limiters</li><li>PTC Inrush Current Limiters</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inrush Current Limiters (ICL) are devices used to limit the sudden surge of current that occurs when an electrical circuit is turned on or energized. There are three main types of ICLs: NTC Inrush Current Limiters, PTC Inrush Current Limiters, and Others. NTC ICLs use a negative temperature coefficient thermistor to reduce current during startup, while PTC ICLs use a positive temperature coefficient thermistor that initially limits current but then allows it to stabilize. The "Others" category includes various types of ICLs such as filters, semiconductor devices, and electromagnetic relays, which also help in limiting inrush current.</p></p>
