<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilators (NiPPV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilation Machine</li><li>BiPAP Ventilation Machine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilators (NiPPV) are medical devices used to provide breathing support to patients without the need for invasive procedures. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) Ventilation Machine is a type of NiPPV that delivers a continuous stream of air pressure to keep the airways open during sleep. BiPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) Ventilation Machine is another type of NiPPV that delivers two different air pressure levels, higher during inhalation and lower during exhalation, to help patients with breathing difficulties. These machines are widely used in treating sleep apnea, respiratory disorders, and other breathing-related conditions.</p></p>
