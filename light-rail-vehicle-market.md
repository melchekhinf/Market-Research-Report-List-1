<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Rail Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lower Capacity</li><li>Higher Capacity</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) market can be divided into two types based on capacity: lower capacity and higher capacity. Lower capacity LRVs typically have a smaller seating arrangement and can accommodate fewer passengers compared to higher capacity LRVs. They are ideal for routes with relatively lower demand or in areas with limited space. On the other hand, higher capacity LRVs are designed to carry larger numbers of passengers, making them suitable for heavily congested routes or areas with high passenger demand.</p></p>
