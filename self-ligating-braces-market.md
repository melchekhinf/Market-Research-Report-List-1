Manufacturers are developing innovative and aesthetically pleasing self-ligating braces that appeal to a wider patient base. The introduction of clear self-ligating braces has also contributed to the market growth, as they provide a more discreet and cosmetically appealing option for patients.</p><p>Additionally, the rising prevalence of dental malocclusions and the growing awareness about the importance of orthodontic treatments have increased the demand for self-ligating braces.
