<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Common Fuel Pump</li><li>GDI Fuel Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Common Fuel Pump: Also known as a mechanical fuel pump, this type of fuel pump is typically used in older vehicles that have a carburetor engine. It operates by using a diaphragm to pull fuel from the gas tank and deliver it to the carburetor.</p><p>GDI Fuel Pump: GDI stands for Gasoline Direct Injection, and GDI fuel pumps are specifically designed for vehicles that use this technology. GDI engines directly inject fuel into the combustion chamber, resulting in improved fuel efficiency and performance. GDI fuel pumps deliver fuel at a much higher pressure to meet the demands of this direct injection system.</p></p>
