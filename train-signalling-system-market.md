<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Train Signalling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Block ATC System</li><li>Moving Block ATC System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Train Signalling System market consists of two main types: Fixed Block ATC System and Moving Block ATC System. In a Fixed Block ATC System, the track is divided into fixed sections called blocks, and only one train is allowed in each block at a time. This system relies on pre-determined distances and track occupancy to ensure safe train separation. On the other hand, a Moving Block ATC System enables continuous train separation by dynamically adjusting the distance between trains based on their speed and braking capabilities, improving overall capacity and efficiency.</p></p>
