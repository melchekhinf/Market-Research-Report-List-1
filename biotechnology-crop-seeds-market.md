<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biotechnology Crop Seeds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Herbicide Tolerant</li><li>Insect Tolerant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biotechnology crop seeds refer to genetically modified plant seeds designed to possess certain desirable traits. These seeds can be categorized into two main types: herbicide tolerant and insect tolerant. Herbicide tolerant seeds are engineered to withstand the application of herbicides, allowing farmers to control weed growth without damaging the crop. Insect tolerant seeds, on the other hand, are modified to produce proteins that are toxic to specific pests, reducing the need for chemical insecticides. Both of these market types provide farmers with effective tools to enhance crop yields and reduce the use of harmful pesticides.</p></p>
