<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Surveillance Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>S-Band</li><li>L-Band</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) market comprises two main types: S-Band and L-Band. S-Band refers to radar systems using frequencies between 2 and 4 GHz, offering long-range detection, but slightly limited accuracy due to atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, L-Band refers to radar systems operating within the range of 1 to 2 GHz, providing a shorter range but better accuracy, thanks to less interference from atmospheric phenomena. Both radar types have their own advantages and are commonly used for air traffic control, military applications, weather monitoring, and maritime surveillance.</p></p>
