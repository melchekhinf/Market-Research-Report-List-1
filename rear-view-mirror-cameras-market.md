<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rear View Mirror Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD Camera</li><li>CMOS Camera</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rear view mirror cameras are widely used in vehicles for enhanced safety and visibility. There are two main types of such cameras: CCD cameras and CMOS cameras. CCD cameras (Charge-Coupled Device) use a sensor to convert light into electrical charges, providing high-quality images with low noise levels. On the other hand, CMOS cameras (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) use a different type of sensor to directly convert light into digital signals. These cameras tend to be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than CCD cameras. Both types offer improved rearview monitoring to help drivers navigate safely.</p></p>
