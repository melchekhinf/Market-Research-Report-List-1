<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-pass Electronic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Electronic Filter</li><li>Active Electronic Filter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high-pass electronic filter market comprises two types: passive electronic filters and active electronic filters. Passive electronic filters allow signals above a certain frequency (known as the cutoff frequency) to pass through while attenuating signals below the cutoff frequency. They do not require an external power source. In contrast, active electronic filters utilize an external power source to achieve signal amplification before filtering. They can be more precise and have adjustable parameters. Both types play a crucial role in various applications that involve removing unwanted low-frequency components from signals.</p></p>
