Sedans are often associated with luxury and are preferred by families and older demographics who prioritize space and comfort.</p><p>Looking towards the future, it is expected that the Sedan & Hatchback Switch market will continue to grow at a steady pace. Factors such as rising fuel prices, increasing urbanization, and the need for more eco-friendly transportation options are likely to drive the demand for hatchbacks.
