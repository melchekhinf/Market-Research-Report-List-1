<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Sprayed Aluminum Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flame Spraying</li><li>Arc Spraying</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Thermal sprayed aluminum coatings refer to a protective layer of aluminum that is applied to surfaces using thermal spray deposition techniques. There are two main types of these coatings: Flame Spraying and Arc Spraying. Flame Spraying involves melting aluminum powder in a flame and propelling it onto the surface using compressed air. Arc Spraying, on the other hand, uses an electric arc to melt aluminum wire, which is then propelled onto the surface using compressed air. Both methods provide effective corrosion protection and are used in various industries.</p></p>
