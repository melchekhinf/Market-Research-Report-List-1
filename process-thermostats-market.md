<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Process Thermostats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Line-voltage Thermostat</li><li>Low-voltage Thermostat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for thermostats can be classified into two main types: line-voltage thermostats and low-voltage thermostats. Line-voltage thermostats are typically used in systems that operate on high voltage, such as electric baseboard heaters or radiant floor heating. These thermostats directly control the power supply to the heating system. On the other hand, low-voltage thermostats are commonly used in central heating and cooling systems, where they control the operation of HVAC equipment by sending signals to a separate control board or unit. Both types serve the purpose of regulating temperature but work differently based on the specific heating system requirements.</p></p>
